# Portfolio Web Page

This project is about a website that is used to show the portfolio of an individual. It resembles a web-resume with more content towards projects. The layout of the page is a modified version of the carousal template of the bootstrap home page
that can be seen [here](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/).

## Prerequisites
* Editor preferably VSCode.
 
        
## Getting Started

* These instructions will guide you to add information about adding your preffered content.
* There are four sections of the html page **header**,  **carousel slides**,  **featurettes** and **footer**. 
* Header has information about the various navigational options on the page.
* Carousel slides provide a bird's overview with navigational options.
* Featurettes section describe each project of the portfolio in details.
* Footer is used to hold navigational options and social media buttons.


## Running the webpage
* Pull files  from the [Portfolio repository](https://github.com/Animesh420/portfolio).
* You can  directly run the html file in your preffered browser to see the result.
* If you prefer to develop more based on this project, try installing browser-sync as it has browser reload capabilites nicely      baked in it. Details can be found [here]("https://www.browsersync.io/").
* If you plan to use browser-synv use the command '**browser-sync start -s '.' -f '.'** '.
